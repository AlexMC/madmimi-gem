## MAD MIMI API (in Ruby) ##

This is a really short little README, but I promise, more is coming soon!

Dependencies:
active_support (I intend to remove this in the not too distant future, and build my own implementation.)

Basic Usage:

mimi = MadMimi.new('emailaddress', 'api_key')

mimi.lists -> get all of your Mad Mimi lists returned as a hash

mimi.memberships('email') -> returns a hash of the lists that specific email address is subscribed to

mimi.new_list('New list name') -> make a new list

mimi.delete_list('New list name') -> delete the list I just created

mimi.csv_import("name,email\ndave,dave@example.com\n") -> import from a csv string

mimi.add_to_list('dave@example.com', 'Test List') -> add this email address to a specific list

mimi.remove_from_list('dave@example.com', 'Test List') -> remove this email address from a specific list

mimi.suppressed_since('unix timestamp') -> get a TXT of all addresses that were suppressed since this timestamp

mimi.promotions -> returns a hash of your promotions

mimi.mailing_stats('promotion_id', 'mailing_id') -> get stats on a specific mailing
